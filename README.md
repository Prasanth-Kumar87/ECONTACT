# ECONTACT
ECONTACT (Energetic CONTributions of Amino acid residues and its possible Cross-Talk) is a new approach to identify potential cross-talks between amino acid residues of protein pocket involved in ligand binding. This approach utilizes per-residue energy terms derived from multiple protein-ligand complexes as variables for principal component analysis (PCA) and identifies top cross-talks which can be tested in any protein-ligand complex.

**Installation (any OS):**
1. Python 2.7 or later with matplotlib, numpy and pandas dependencies

I am preparing the readthedocs.
